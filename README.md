# How to use

This repository contains regularly updated course materials. You can use lecture slides for self study (they are written as lecture notes). Lecture recordings from this and last year offerings are linked below. The links in the Self-study with Colab section are both for self-study and reviewing the practical sessions. Refer to the book and resourses suggestions at the bottom of the page.

# For contributors

Pull requests with suggestions and improvements, however small or big, are welcome!

The changes in lecture slides are going through an automated check.

The PDFs are compiled and updated automatically when PR is merged (thanks to k1rill-fedoseev from the 2020 Linear Control class!). You don't need to update them manually. They are also uploaded as workflow artifacts for every new commit pushed into this repository. You can use them to see your changes.
 
Consider adding \*.pdf to the .git/info/exclude file on your local repo. Here is the ~~overy long but helpful~~ [description why it works](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/exclude-files-from-git-without-committing-changes-to-gitignore-986fa712e78d)
